# Kausal Watch Action Plan Monitoring UI

[![GPLv3 License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL%20v3-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/)

React UI for browsing and visualizing action plans. Built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

- Displays data from [Kausal Watch API](https://github.com/kausaltech/kausal-watch)

## Development

#### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18.x
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) 3.2.1

#### Getting Started

Clone the repository, install the dependencies and run the development server locally:

    yarn set version 3.2.1
    yarn config set nodeLinker 'node-modules'
    yarn install
    yarn dev

Preview the application locally at http://localhost:3000/

#### Environment Variables

Define the following variables in `.env` if you need to override them for local development.
Variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are build-time variables, which are available in client components.
When using environment variables in client-side code, import them from `@/common/environment` to support fallbacks.

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (previously APLANS_API_BASE_URL): Configure a custom API URL, e.g. staging or a local backend.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT_TYPE`: Change the deployment type, e.g. `staging` or `production`.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WILDCARD_DOMAINS`: List of domains that should be interpreted in form `plan-id.domain`.

For production, you must additionally set the following variables:

- `AUTH_SECRET`: Randomly generated secret string
- `AUTH_TRUST_HOST`: Set to `true`. Ensure that the reverse proxy sets `X-Forwarded-Host` securely.

#### End-to-end Testing

Before the first run, ensure the browsers Playwright needs are installed:

    node_modules/.bin/playwright install

Then add the plan identifiers you want to test to your `.env` file:

    TEST_INSTANCE_IDENTIFIERS=abcd,efgh,ijlk

To point tests to the specific environment use the following environment variable in `.env` file:

TEST_PAGE_BASE_URL=http://{planId}.localhost:3000

or

TEST_PAGE_BASE_URL=http://{planId}.watch.staging.kausal.tech

Now you should be able to run the test suite. You might want to start
either the development or the production server first. If you don't, the
test suite will start one for you (the dev server will be started if the
`TEST_DEVSERVER` env variable is set). You should be able to run the test
suite like this:

    node_modules/.bin/playwright test

#### Building the custom version of plotly.js

If you need to add new plot types, or update to the upstream version of plotly.js,
clone the [plotly.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js) and
run the following commands:

    npm install
    npx change-package-name @kausal/plotly-custom
    npm run empty-dist && npm run locales && npm run bundle && npm run schema dist
    TRACES=scatter,icicle,pie,bar
    npm run custom-bundle -- --unminified --traces ${TRACES}
    npm run custom-bundle -- --traces ${TRACES}
    npm publish --access public

#### Debugging

Debug server side GraphQL queries by setting the `LOG_GRAPHQL_QUERIES=true` environment variable. This will log all outgoing queries and variables in your dev server console.

## Building and deploying in production

To run the app in production mode:

    yarn install
    yarn build
    yarn start

## Good to know

- If you're using VSCode, install the Apollo GraphQL extension for GQL query autocompletion and deprecation warnings
